# BME_Bladder_Sensor_2021-22
This is the code base used to work with the Bladder Sensor Design created by Team 7 for their BME Senior Capstone Project. Please see the README for previous version information and a description of the software  

This arduino code base was developed as an offshoot of the code base provided by previous team member, Sarah O'Shay. The arduino code listed in the .imo file is used in both calibration and in actual testing, capable of reporting the magnitude, gain factors, and impedance being detected. This .imo file should be functional and all capabilities are commented within the code.

As far as the Android Studio code base, this was also developed upon previous team member's code base. However, due to the team prior using an outdated version of Android since they were using an old personal phone that they had, I needed to rollback the code slightly and develop the code in a different direction to allow for Bluetooth capability, Android version capability, and Notification capability. Although her code is no longer functional with the Motorola Android device that is currently stored in the project, if you would like to visit her code base for reference, you can visit it at https://github.com/vulvullatin/Bluno-App . Otherwise, the Android Studio project stored in BladderSensor2022Submission contains all of the current functionality required to edit inside of Android Studio.
